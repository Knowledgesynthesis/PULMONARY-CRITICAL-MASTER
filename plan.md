# **6. Pulmonary Reasoning Framework**

Universal logic:
1. Stabilize (ABCs, oxygen, NIPPV if indicated).  
2. Identify syndrome (obstructive, parenchymal, vascular, infectious).  
3. Determine acuity & severity.  
4. Order appropriate imaging (CXR, CT).  
5. Apply validated scoring systems (Wells, CURB-65).  
6. Initiate correct management tier (educational).  
7. Anticipate complications (respiratory failure, sepsis, ARDS).  
8. Reassess and escalate early when needed.  

**Pitfalls to highlight:**
- Overusing D-dimer in high-risk PE  
- Missing OSA contributing to chronic hypercapnia  
- Misclassifying pneumonia onset (CAP vs HAP/VAP)  
- Failing to identify ARDS early  
- Incorrect NIPPV use in asthma exacerbation  
- Missing silent hypoxemia
